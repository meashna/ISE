### **Monitoring Safety Performance**

Monitoring safety performance is critical for understanding workplace hazards and taking preventive measures. Metrics like **Frequency Rate**, **Severity Rate**, **Incidence Rate**, and **Activity Rate** are used to evaluate and improve safety standards.


#### **1. Frequency Rate**

**Definition:**  
The frequency rate measures the number of disabling injuries per one million man-hours worked. It provides an indicator of how often accidents occur.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Frequency Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of disabling injuries}}{\text{Total man-hours worked}} \right) \times 1,000,000
\]

**Example Calculation:**  
- Number of disabling injuries = 5  
- Number of workers = 500  
- Average hours worked per worker per year = 2,000  
- Total man-hours = \( 500 \times 2000 = 1,000,000 \)

\[
\text{Frequency Rate} = \frac{5}{1,000,000} \times 1,000,000 = 5
\]

**Application:**  
Used to monitor accident trends and set targets for improvement.


#### **2. Severity Rate**

**Definition:**  
The severity rate indicates the total number of workdays lost or charged due to accidents per one million man-hours worked.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Severity Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of man-days lost due to accidents}}{\text{Total man-hours worked}} \right) \times 1,000,000
\]

**Example Calculation:**  
- Days lost = 100 actual + 35 standard = 135  
- Total man-hours = \( 2000 \times 2000 = 4,000,000 \)

\[
\text{Severity Rate} = \frac{135}{4,000,000} \times 1,000,000 = 33.75
\]

**Application:**  
Helps assess the impact of accidents in terms of lost productivity and time.


#### **3. Incidence Rate**

**Definition:**  
The incidence rate represents the number of lost-time injuries per thousand employees.

**Formula:**  
\[
\text{Incidence Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of lost-time injuries}}{\text{Total employees}} \right) \times 1,000
\]

**Example Calculation:**  
- Number of lost-time injuries = 10  
- Number of employees = 2,000  

\[
\text{Incidence Rate} = \frac{10}{2000} \times 1,000 = 5
\]

**Application:**  
Used to compare safety performance across departments or organizations.


#### **4. Activity Rate**

**Definition:**  
The activity rate evaluates the overall safety promotional and awareness activities conducted in a year relative to the total employees and man-hours worked.

**Key Factors:**
- Includes safety training, safety inspections, and awareness programs.
- Highlights the cost-effectiveness of accident prevention activities.

**Formula (Conceptual):**  
\[
\text{Activity Rate} = \frac{\text{Safety activities conducted in a year}}{\text{Total employees and man-hours worked}}
\]

**Application:**  
Measures the proactive efforts taken to reduce workplace hazards.


#### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Frequency Rate:** Measures accident occurrence.
- **Severity Rate:** Evaluates the impact of accidents in terms of lost time.
- **Incidence Rate:** Focuses on the prevalence of injuries per workforce size.
