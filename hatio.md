Using **backticks** (`` ` ``) in expressions like ``t(`/projects/${id}`)`` instead of single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes is necessary when you need **template literals** in JavaScript. Template literals allow for string interpolation and multi-line strings, which cannot be directly achieved with single or double quotes.

### Key Reasons to Use Backticks (`` ` ``):
1. **String Interpolation**:
   - Backticks allow you to embed expressions within strings using `${}`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const id = 123;
     const url = `/projects/${id}`; // Using template literal
     // Equivalent to:
     const url = '/projects/' + id; // Using string concatenation
     ```
   - Without backticks, you would need to use concatenation, which is less readable and more error-prone.

2. **Multi-line Strings**:
   - Backticks can span multiple lines directly, unlike single or double quotes.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const message = `This is a
     multi-line string.`;
     ```

3. **Dynamic Content**:
   - Backticks are useful when you construct dynamic strings, like in your example ``t(`/projects/${id}`)``.

### Why Not Use Single or Double Quotes (`'` or `"`)?
- Single or double quotes **do not support interpolation** directly. If you use them, you'd need to manually concatenate strings, like:
  ```javascript
  const id = 123;
  const url = '/projects/' + id; // Manual concatenation
  ```

### When to Use Each:
- **Backticks (` `` `)**: When you need dynamic content, interpolation, or multi-line strings.
- **Single or Double Quotes (`'` or `"`):** For static strings or when you don't need interpolation. Example:
  ```javascript
  const url = '/projects/static-id';
  ```

In summary, backticks are essential for dynamic strings with variables or expressions (`${}`), while single/double quotes are sufficient for static content.
