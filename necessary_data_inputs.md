## **Data Flow Overview**

To visualize how these data points interact within your system, here's a simplified flow:

1. **User Inputs:**
   - Last period date range (start and end dates).
   - Average cycle length (specific days or range).
   - Bleeding duration (specific days or range).
   - Cycle length variability.
   - Additional information (birth control usage, fertility treatments).

2. **System Processing:**
   - **Calculate Days Since Last Period:**
     - `Days Since Last Period = Current Date - Last Period Start Date`
   - **Determine Current Cycle Day:**
     - `Current Cycle Day = Days Since Last Period + 1`
   - **Calculate Next Period Start Date:**
     - `Next Period Start Date = Last Period Start Date + Average Cycle Length`
     - Adjust for variability if applicable.
   - **Determine Ovulation Date:**
     - `Ovulation Date = Next Period Start Date - 14 days`
     - Adjust based on cycle length variability.
   - **Identify Fertility Window:**
     - `Fertility Window Start = Ovulation Date - 5 days`
     - `Fertility Window End = Ovulation Date`
     - Adjust for variability if necessary.

3. **Generate Output:**
   - **Current Cycle Status:**
     - "Today, Feb 22"
     - "Day 16 Peak fertility"
   - **Cycle Predictions:**
     - "Your next period may start on Nov 5."
     - "You are likely to ovulate on Oct 18."
     - "Best chances of conceiving are from Oct 13 to Oct 18."

## **Detailed Data Requirements**

## **Example Data Flow**

Let's walk through an example to illustrate how these data inputs are used to generate predictions.

### **User Inputs:**
- **Last Period Date Range:** May 5 to May 9
- **Average Cycle Length:** 28 days
- **Bleeding Duration:** 5 days
- **Cycle Length Variability:** ±2 days
- **Additional Information:**
  - **Birth Control Usage:** No
  - **Fertility Treatments:** No

### **System Calculations:**
1. **Days Since Last Period:**
   - Assuming today's date is February 22.
   - Calculate the number of days from May 5 to February 22.
   - (Note: In reality, cycles are typically tracked month-to-month. Ensure the dates make sense chronologically.)

2. **Current Cycle Day:**
   - `Days Since Last Period + 1 = 16`

3. **Next Period Start Date:**
   - `May 5 + 28 days = June 2`
   - **With Variability:** June 2 ± 2 days → May 31 to June 4

4. **Ovulation Date:**
   - `Next Period Start Date - 14 days = May 19`
   - **With Variability:** May 19 ± 2 days → May 17 to May 21

5. **Fertility Window:**
   - **Start:** `Ovulation Date - 5 days = May 14`
   - **End:** `Ovulation Date = May 19`
   - **With Variability:**
     - Start: May 14 ± 2 days → May 12 to May 16
     - End: May 19 ± 2 days → May 17 to May 21
     - Fertility Window Range: May 12 to May 21

### **Generated Output:**
- **Current Cycle Status:**
  - "Today, Feb 22"
  - "Day 16 Peak fertility"
- **Cycle Predictions:**
  - "Your next period may start between May 31 and June 4."
  - "You are likely to ovulate between May 17 and May 21."
  - "Best chances of conceiving are from May 12 to May 21."

- **Handling Irregularities:**
  - When users indicate high variability, present predictions as ranges rather than fixed dates to communicate uncertainty.
  - Offer explanations or disclaimers about the accuracy of predictions in cases of irregular cycles or recent birth control usage.

- **Privacy and Security:**
  - Ensure that all user data is handled securely, adhering to data protection regulations like GDPR.
  - Clearly communicate your privacy policy to users, especially if storing their data for future reference.

- **Responsive Design:**
